									<h6>What is Scratch?</h6>
                                    <p>Scratch is a visual programming language that we learnt on our first week of lesson to create our own interactive stories, games and animation.<p>
								<h6>What is visual programming?</h6>
								<p>Is a sort of programming language that allows users to illustrate processes. It's for developers to explain the process in words that are understandable to humans.<p>
<h6>What are some programming principles that you have discovered?</h6>
<p>Some principles that I have found on the internet..<p>
	<li>programs for people, not computers</li>
	<li>things once and only once</li>
	<li>Use a version control system</li>
	<li>Optimize software only after it works correctly</li>
	<li>Be a good code citizen</li>
	<li>Keep it short</li>
	<li>Language-specific style guides</li>
</p>I still do not fully comprehend these principles and I hope I will be able to apply these as the course progresses. . and as I dive in more.</p>

								<h6>What is Git?</h6>
								<p>Git is an Open Sourced Distributed Version Control System. Is a software for developers to use to store codes, track revision history, merge code changes and revert to earlier codes if needed.</p>
								<h6>What is Github?</h6>
								<p>GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code.</p>

									<h6>What is Python?</h6>
									<p>In week 3 we did some coding practise to basic Python language syntax and practise doing some coding in the lab. We were provided with some activities but it ain't easy. I could only complete the first 2 activity.. and then my head started to hurt. I did some research online and found a phyton code execution for 1 of the activity, however I was still unable to comprehend as I wonder how did it know what to use when I have not been taught of that specific code. How sad is this.. I could only complete 2 activity. </p>
									<h6>Activity 1</h6>
									<h6>Calculate a dog's age in dog's years</h6>
									<body>
<pre>human_age = int(input("Input a dog's age in human years: "))
if human_age < 0:
("Age must be positive number.")
exit()
human_age <= 2:
= human_age * 10.5
else:
og_age = 21 + (human_age - 2)*4
print("The dog's age in dog's years is", dog_age)</pre>
<body>
	<h6>Activity 2</h6>
	<h6>Convert month name to a number of days</h6>
	<body>
<pre>print("List of months are January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, 
	December")
month = input("input the name of Month:")
if month == "February" :
    print("No. of days: 28/29 days")
elif month in ("April", "June", "September", "November") : 
    print("No. of days: 30 days")
elif month in ("January", "March", "May", "July", "August", "October", "December") :
    print("No. of days: 31 Days")
else:
    print("wrong month name")</pre>

	<h6>Video-Graph</h6>
	<h6>How did you feel as a subject of a video? Did you notice your ego? How are we evolving with this device? How could we draw this activity? Did you feel more attachment to the phone than to your image?</h6>
<p>I don't think I was a subject of a video as we weren't able to see everyone's video. I definitely felt lost after this class. Even when Roman tried to elaborate it after the class, I was still @.@... definitely still at wonderland with what I'm going to do for my project.</p>
<p>Roman showed us a video by Michael Logie that contains a series of flickering and flashing visuals and that gave me an idea for my project. I was thinking of using the same concept. I was thinking of doing a futuristic retro world where humans are ceased to exist and there's my cat wondering around trying to find me. I might still be alive, I might not. Kinda similar to the game "Stray" where the stray cat wanders around and interact with it's surroundings. But mine would just be to tell a story of a cat trying to find it's owner. Now how do I start? I can't even code yet... @.@. But just then rewatching it kinda gave me a headache. So I'm not sure anymore.</p>

		<h2>Week 5</h2>	
	</header>
	<h6>Agile Development Introduction</h6>	
	<p>The class did a "Stand up" today and Roman got everyone in class to talk about what they did in the weekend and their ideas for their project. It's interesting to hear other peoples idea and what their concept for their project is going to be. Seems like majority already have it planned. I'm still clueless here... gg...
</p>This week lab session we had to create the tallest tower using only spaghetti sticks, 1 marshmallow, a string and tape. We had 3 groups competing against each other. We weren't allow to google and we had to put our brains together to come up with a concept to get the marshmallow to stay up. It wasn't hard but it wasn't easy. The spaghetti stick breaks, the tape is not sticking, the tower is collaping. We first had it stuck to the ceiling, working our way from the top to the bottom. That was not allowed but it worked. We had a tower. 2nd attempt fail. It kinda stayed and then one of us accidentally touched it and fell to the ground. 3rd attempt, not the tallest tower but it stayed just good enough for Roman to take a picture and then it crumbled. It was definitely a fun activity I must say. Just wished we could have come up with a better strategy to make our tower more solid. After the class, I googled it and there was some really cool ones and they had more marshmallows. I believe if our resources also weren't so limited, everyone could make a cool standing tower. My husband is a builder, so instantly when you thought of building or making a tower, you'll need to have a strong foundation but it's different in software. You'll have to build from the top and keep pushing it to the top. Very interesting.</p>
Roman was telling us that kindergarden kids would ace this and CEOs will fail. Cause kids are simple, they are told what to do and they just do it, they don't complicate things. Where as CEOs have alot of input and when you get alot of inputs at once - they can clash. Maybe I should try this with my son at home.</p>

<h4>Python Koans</h4>
<h6>What is Python Koans?</h6>
<p>Python Koans is an interactive tutorial for learning the Python programming language by making tests pass. Most tests are fixed by filling the missing parts of assert functions. Eg: self.assertEqual(__, 1+2). There is about 300 koans to do and I have completed 12 (3%) and 1 (out of 37) lessons. It get's harder as you complete them but nonetheless, it seems like a very good practise.</p>
