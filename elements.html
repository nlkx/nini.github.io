<h5>Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?</h5>
<p>Sure did.. during class I will take a moment to look out the window, seeing what's happening around down there while I'm up on the 14th floor. That's why I like to sit next to the window. I can stare out to the sky and look at the clouds. On the very first day of class, I saw a girl walking around barefeet with a blanket wrapped around her.. very strange.. a person approached her and seem to be helping her call someone and then they walked into a blindspot where I can no longer see them. I have a habit of clicking my fingers so.. and yes I did stretch.</p>
<h5>What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?</h5>
<p>Ya, what is timeboxing? Why you no explain? ok so I just googled it and.... looks like its some sort of time management technique. I'm pretty good at time management.. sooo if I ever need to use it. I'll definitely try it.</p>
<h5>On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?</h5>
<p>Definitely not confident. -0. Don't even know what I'm doing half of the time. The only time I was ever confident in my assignment was back in high school for my photography final project. I can say I was confident because I got an Excellence for my final mark and I was super happy about it and I had a passion for photography back then. </p>
<h5>What are of you proud of up to this point in the course?</h5>	
<p>That I know what python is. LOL but I still don't know how to code. Just with the 1st activity regarding the dog and human age, I had to google it and get a better understanding of how to decipher it.</p>
<h5>Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself.</h5>						
<p>I feel like for me.. I don't always absorb information in the first instance. I'm not very good at listening sometimes, so for the lectures.. I will visit the recordings again. Which I think helped so much more. Thank god for recorded lectures. It was the same case back in uni. I get distracted easily as well and I loooooooooooove to procrastinate haha... and I feel like you get more out of something by doing it hands on instead of just words. I'm definitely more of a visual person with examples to make it more relatable.</p>
<h5>If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?</h5>
<p>Don't give up! it might still not make sense now but.. it will at the end.</p>
<h5>What is Python?</h5>
<p>A type of snake. Also a computer programming language often used to build websites and software. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialised for any specific problems.</p>
<h5>Have you developed a habit of exploring?</h5>
<p>If I read a specific news article about a murder that happened.. I will usually google the murderer and check out what his/her life was before, how they were brought up and what led them to kill. Does that count as exploring?</p>
<h5>Have you meditated before?</h5>
<p>Yes, in my hot yoga class but those are very brief.. wasn't able to really free my mind and just think. I was all sweaty and feeling yucky. Just wanted to get out of there asap.</p>
<h5>Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?</h5>
<p>Snowboarding. And I'm pretty good at those rhythm game. You play this game by pressing the correct keys on the keyboard along with the music. I do play games too. But it's MMORPG so I wouldn't say it's skilled based more like the items you have that makes you OP.</p>
<h5>Do you consider yourself a developer yet?</h5>
<p>Definitely not. I can't even get past activity 3. I feel like I need to understand what those commands are in order for me to understand when it can be used and where to use it. I just need to practise more.</p>
<h5>Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?</h5>
<p>Who doesn't? it enables us to come up with new ideas and solve problems in innovative ways. People are attracted to new stuff, stuff they have not seen before. Stuff that is exciting or else people wouldn't be buying the new iphone each time it comes out. Creativity is an important part of our lives because without creativity we wouldn’t have the things that bring us so much happiness and satisfaction. When people express their feelings through art, music, or stories, they can share their thoughts and emotions with other people. When you’re creative, you find it easier to find good solutions and come up with new ideas. Creative expression is a tool you can use to solve problems and situations.</p>
<h5>How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?</h5>
<p>I have 8 windows open and 36 tabs. 18 tabs is study related and 18 tabs is distraction related. I'm surprised it's balanced. I would have thought I have more distraction tabs open.</p>
<h5>Have you had a fight response to technology? What does it feel like? How did you overcome this?</h5>
<p>Numerous times.. trying to sync music onto my itunes, it says sync complete but no music was on my itunes. Trying to answer this question but my eyes decided to stop focusing. It feels frustrating for sure when you think you're doing all the right steps but it's not going how it's supposed to. I overcome it by stopping everything. unplug and plug it again and try it all over again from the beginning. If that didn't work I will approach it in a different way/method.</p>
<h5>What is an IDE?</h5>
<p>From Google: An integrated development environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. IDE makes it easy to see a visual representation of the files and makes it more understandable for the user. All these are very new to me. I hope it's ok I copied from Google. Since I wasn't sure what they are in the first place.</p>
<h5>What did you learn out of the Marshmallow Challenge?</h5>
<p>It's ok to fail, cause everytime you fail.. you know not to use the same method you use the first time and try a different way until it works.</p>
<h5>Did you have any blocks during this challenge? How did you overcome them?</h5>
<p>Tape was not secured enough and putting too much pressure while wrapping the tape around the spaghetti sticks and ended up breaking them. A team mate keep eating the marshmallow. Told the team mate to get more marshmallow and to stop eating them. Handled the sticks with TLC and we finally manage to get the marshmallow to stay until a picture was taken.</p>
<h5>So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?</h5>
<p>Understanding how to code. I still have no idea.. I really hope I will be able to at the end of the course. But as I'm typing this on visual studio and seeing how it reflects onto the website instaneously is amazing to me and it gives me a feel of certainty. Like hey.. maybe I can be a programmer.</p>
<h5>What is OOP?</h5>
<p>From Google again: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterised by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods.</p>
<h5>Are you using the canvas content? Do you find it helpful or tedious?</h5>
<p>Not so much as I am more of a visual person, I tend to youtube or google first. When it's too much reading my eyes just go out of focus. But I just had a look in canvas again and under pages, there is all the information that I will ever need. It does save me alot of time from having to google everytime. I just need to sit down and go through the contents in canvas. </p>
<h5>Which parts of the work did you find tedious?</h5>
<p>reading.. reading.. and more reading.</p>
<h5>What is polymorphism?</h5>
<p>Is the characteristic of being able to assign a different meaning or usage to something in different contexts - specifically, to allow an entity such as a variable, a function, or an object to have more than one form.</p>
<h5>Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this last few weeks? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?</h5>
<p>My inner voice saying: Why am I not getting it? I dont undestand.. Will I ever be able to understand it? Or will I fail this class? I really don't want to fail this class... Why am I not smart? I just really don't want to fail this class.</p>
<h5>What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?</h5>
<p>A product with minimum set of features to attract early users and validate the idea in the initial phase of the product development cycle. We're going to give you this keyboard that has a few cool features, it can play music, record what you played, lights flashes as you hit the keys and it you can put in any time of other noises you want. You'll need to tell us which feature you like the most from the keyboard and tell us if there's anything you think we can add to make the keyboard even cooler.</p>
<h5>What is the hardest problem you have solved so far?</h5>
<p>Not able to answer this question. It was hard trying get this website working at the start, the spacings was just too big and the paragraph was not aligned and it took me a while and finally found the code for it and got it working the way I want it to be.</p>
<h5>What is pair programming?</h5>
<p>2 programmers team up together working on 1 computer. From Google: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.</p>
<h5>What are you looking forward to learning about programming?</h5>
<p>I want to be able to code easily and create softwares, websites from front to the end. To be able to program something useful and convenient for the user.</p>
<h5>What is conscious listening?</h5>
<p>From Google: Conscious listening is the process of listening to others by subtracting the fears, beliefs, expectations, judgments, and control strategies both within yourself and others from the process in order to understand the deepest motivations and intentions behind our words and theirs. I am usually a very good listener when it comes to my girl friends dramas and worries, I may not be able to give good advices all the time but I'll always provide feedback and what I think she could do or not do and it's up to her if she wants to follow through with that.</p>
<h5>What is a variable?</h5>
<p>A variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. Typically, a program consists of instructions that tell the computer what to do and data that the program uses when it is running.</p>
<h5>What programming languages are you interested in learning? Why?</h5>
<p>I guess for now it could be Python. Since it will be the easiest to learn. I want to be able to atleast kinda master 1 programming language first and then slowly explore other programming languages.</p>
<h5>What is something kind that someone has done for you?</h5>
<p>Can't think of 1 at the top of my head at the moment but the car infront of me thank me cause I let him/her cut infront. Just these little things really stood out for me. I don't think it's always about giving that is considered kind but the thought and the gesture.</p>
<h5>If you were describing programming to someone who knows nothing about it, what would you say?</h5>
<p>Computer programming is a set of instructions to facilitate specific actions. If you're wondering what a computer programmer is, it's a professional that creates instructions for a computer to execute by writing and testing code that enables applications and software programs to operate successfully.</p>
<h5>Which parts of this course made you feel doubtful of your own innate ability?</h5>
<p>This whole course. I decided to take this course knowing nothing about programming and even from the start I'm already doubting myself if I will be able to understand the materials or if I will pass this course. But after starting the course I learnt that I need to embrace the fact that I'm not great at it yet and knowing that it is okay...</p>
<h5>What is a fixed mindset?</h5>
<p>A fixed mindset is like if I don't try new or hard things, then I won't fail. Not allowing yourself to grow or to take up challenges. Thinks that their intelligence and talent is fixed. Sometimes I feel like that... ahh just want to give up, I can't do this.. but then I get frustrated at myself for not being able to do it and so I get up and keep trying until I did it. The satisfaction you get from accomplishing it sure is sweet. Now I can snowboard.</p>
<h5>What is something kind you have done for someone else?</h5>
<p>Just last week I offered to drop a fellow classmate off to where ever she needs to go after class because it was raining.</p>
<h5>Have you done mindfulness or attention training before?</h5>
<p>No I haven't. I have heard good things about it and that it uses sounds in a formal exercise to help us see thoughts, and our attention, in a different way, which will result in an increased ability to distance ourselves from unhelpful thoughts, and improve our ability to control our focus of attention. Maybe one day I will try it.</p>
<h5>Have you developed a habit of persevering?</h5>
<p>I will now. I am determined to pass all my assignments and this course. I use to just quit as soon as it gets hard. But now I have a goal and I intend to achieve this goal. I am going to force myself to stick with it even if I encounter any obstacles or setbacks. I'll just need to practise mindfulness and attention training to focus my attention on my goal.</p>
